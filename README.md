# About Me
I'm a college student studying Networking and Cybersecurity. Programming is a hobby of mine, I could never be a professional programmer. 

## What am I good at?
Need to wipe your OS and start fresh? I'm your guy. Not sure how to set up your internet? I can configure it for you. Oh no, your computer broke; let me fix it. I also run my own servers at home.

Notice how none of that has anything to do with programming. I can script, I can code, but I won't claim to be skilled with either one.
