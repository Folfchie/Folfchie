# About Me

I'm not a progammer, I'm a scripter.

I specialize in computer networking and telecommunications. Languages I am familiar with including Python, Powershell, and Bash.

Notice my usage of the word *fammiliar*. I do not claim to be an expert, and I am always learning!

My public repositories include tools that I have created and released for anyone who finds them interesting or useful.
